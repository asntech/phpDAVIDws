It gives limited control for the user to communicate with the DAVID website to get biological meaning for the list of genes/proteins. Due to its limitations, DAVID team recently developed a web service interface (DAVID-WS) by giving a full control over all its functionalities (Jiao et al., 2012). To connect and communicate with the DAVID web service bioinformaticians, biocurators need a client which is developed in a programming language of their interest. For some programming languages, DAVID-WS clients have been already made available including; Python, Perl, Matlab, Java (Jiao et al., 2012) and R (Fresno et al. 2013). PHP is one of most used web development programming language to develop online bioinformatics tools and a databases. But, currently there is no PHP based client is available to access the DAVID web services. Hence we developed a class-based PHP interface to access all the DAVID-WS functionalities in a PHP environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nTo install, simply download phpDAVIDws and include the autoload.php to where you want to use the service. \r\n\r\n```php\r\n\r\nrequire 'phpDAVIDws/david_autoloader.php';\r\n\r\n```\r\n## How to use\r\nUsers are required to register before using this service If you are a new user, please register at http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/webservice/register.htm. \r\n     \r\n```php\r\nrequire 'phpDAVIDws/david_autoloader.php';\r\n\r\n$service = new DAVIDWebService();\r\n$email = \"yourname@yourorganization.org\";\r\n\r\n$request = new authenticate($email);\r\n\r\n//it will return a authenticateResponse object\r\n$response = $service->authenticate($request);\r\n\r\nif($response->getReturn() == \"true\"){\r\n\t//perform anaotation\r\n}\r\nelse{\r\n\t//Register or check your email.\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n##phpDAVIDws Documentation\r\nA detailed documentation can be found here: http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/software/phpDAVIDws/doc/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
